# ‚õè (WIP) Waitlist

{% hint style="info" %}
Transparency stands as a cornerstone in the emerging world of web3 projects.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

PoLN embodies this ethos, emphasizing the importance of openness and accountability. In a landscape where the trust of stakeholders is paramount, maintaining public visibility into source code becomes not just an ethical choice, but a strategic one.

{% hint style="success" %}
The choice to keep PoLN's source code in public repositories isn't merely about signaling honesty. It fosters a collaborative environment, encouraging community contributions, peer reviews, and shared innovation.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

By doing so, PoLN aims to create a thriving ecosystem, underpinned by shared values and collaborative spirit.

In the broader context of blockchain and decentralized platforms, where trustless interactions are celebrated, PoLN's commitment to transparency further solidifies its position.&#x20;

After all, in a realm where code often acts as the law, the ability for all to see, review, and understand that code becomes fundamental to the project's success and longevity.
