# ⏳ (PEND) Architecture Overview

With a design that's scalable, flexible, and robust, PoLN's architecture stands prepared to redefine the paradigms of decentralized systems.

## Multi-Blockchain Compatibility
PoLN isn't bound to a single Ethereum chain but thrives on the interoperability offered by Ethereum-compatible platforms. 

By leveraging these platforms, PoLN's smart contracts can be deployed across various networks, ensuring flexibility and a broader reach.

## On-Chain Dynamics
The heart of PoLN lies in its smart contracts. 

These on-chain scripts, developed in Solidity, function as self-executing contracts where the terms directly written into code lines. 

Before making their mark on the mainnet, these contracts undergo thorough testing on testnets, ensuring they're error-free and optimized for performance and security.

## Off-Chain Prowess
Our off-chain components, developed in GoLang, serve as bridges between the on-chain data and the users. 

These RESTful APIs not only ensure swift data retrieval and manipulation but also seamlessly integrate with the smart contracts, offering a harmonious blend of speed and security.

The use of Docker/Kubernetes clusters for deployment signifies PoLN's commitment to a hyper-scalable architecture, ready to handle surges in demand.

## User Interaction & Frontend
The frontend, crafted in Angular, serves as the user's gateway to PoLN's protocol.

It's designed with user experience at the forefront, ensuring smooth interactions. 

Integration with wallets like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download/) and Coinbase becomes seamless, courtesy of the [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/) library, facilitating easy and secure transactions.


## Seamless Deployment & DevOps
In the rapidly evolving world of tech, continuous deployment is not just an advantage but a necessity. 

GitHub and GitHub Actions synergize to ensure our services, be it frontend or REST API, always run the latest, most optimized versions.

Cloud platforms like Heroku and AWS further enhance the system's accessibility, ensuring high availability and performance.

## Open Source – A Commitment
PoLN believes in the collective strength of the developer community. 

By making the entire codebase accessible on fairhive-lab’s GitHub, PoLN invites collective innovation, feedback, and enhancements, all while ensuring transparency.

{% hint style="success" %}
The architectural foundation of PoLN is meticulously crafted, intertwining technology with vision. 

Each architectural decision echoes one or more of its ten core objectives:

1. **Forge a Supportive Community**: The architecture is deeply rooted in collaboration. The open-source nature of the protocol, with all its code hosted on fairhive-lab’s GitHub, ensures an environment where the community can actively engage, contribute, and have a sense of collective ownership.

2. **Foster Inclusivity and Accessibility**: Designed for widespread access, the multi-blockchain compatibility ensures that PoLN reaches users across diverse Ethereum-compatible chains, thus broadening the horizon for interactions.

3. **Empower Labor**: The decision to decentralize backend services and embrace smart contracts ensures that every contributor's work is transparently recognized, validating individual roles and empowering labor.

4. **Facilitate Equitable Wealth Distribution**: Structured public and private sales strategies have been designed to prevent undue concentration of tokens, making certain that the distribution of $POLN is broad and equitable. Developers and other contributors are essential pillars of the ecosystem. Recognizing their invaluable input, the architecture also emphasizes rewarding their efforts, ensuring they partake in the wealth generated by the platform.

5. **Promote Ethical Transactions**: All transactions on PoLN are transparent and immutable due to their on-chain nature, ensuring traceability and accountability, which in turn fosters ethical behavior.

6. **Implement Secure and Rapid Crypto-Payments**: PoLN's smart contracts ensure rapidity in settlements. The security and efficiency of established blockchain networks are leveraged for crypto-payments.

7. **Enhance Stakeholder Participation**: Off-chain services in PoLN are designed to be interactive and community-driven. Tools like Metamask facilitate direct protocol interactions for stakeholders.

8. **Community-Driven Protocol Development**: The community stands at the forefront of the protocol's evolution. The open and modular nature of the architecture ensures that PoLN continually adapts based on collective decisions.

9. **Drive Innovation and Modernization**: With a frontend crafted with Angular and the integration of ethers.js, PoLN promises a contemporary user experience. Continuous technological updates are facilitated via platforms like GitHub and CircleCI.

10. **Strengthen Trust and Reliability**: The emphasis on transparency and the usage of reliable services like Heroku and AWS ensure the unwavering trustworthiness and reliability of the PoLN ecosystem.
