# ⏳ (PEND) Architecture Overview

With a design that's scalable, flexible, and robust, PoLN's architecture stands prepared to redefine the paradigms of decentralized systems.

## Multi-Blockchain Compatibility
PoLN isn't bound to a single Ethereum chain but thrives on the interoperability offered by Ethereum-compatible platforms. 

By leveraging these platforms, PoLN's smart contracts can be deployed across various networks, ensuring flexibility and a broader reach.

## On-Chain Dynamics
The heart of PoLN lies in its smart contracts. 

These on-chain scripts, developed in Solidity, function as self-executing contracts where the terms directly written into code lines. 

Before making their mark on the mainnet, these contracts undergo thorough testing on testnets, ensuring they're error-free and optimized for performance and security.

## Off-Chain Prowess
Our off-chain components, developed in GoLang, serve as bridges between the on-chain data and the users. 

These RESTful APIs not only ensure swift data retrieval and manipulation but also seamlessly integrate with the smart contracts, offering a harmonious blend of speed and security.

The use of Docker/Kubernetes clusters for deployment signifies PoLN's commitment to a hyper-scalable architecture, ready to handle surges in demand.

## User Interaction & Frontend
The frontend, crafted in Angular, serves as the user's gateway to PoLN's protocol.

It's designed with user experience at the forefront, ensuring smooth interactions. 

Integration with wallets like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download/) and Coinbase becomes seamless, courtesy of the [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/) library, facilitating easy and secure transactions.


## Seamless Deployment & DevOps
In the rapidly evolving world of tech, continuous deployment is not just an advantage but a necessity. 

GitHub and GitHub Actions synergize to ensure our services, be it frontend or REST API, always run the latest, most optimized versions.

Cloud platforms like Heroku and AWS further enhance the system's accessibility, ensuring high availability and performance.

## Open Source – A Commitment
PoLN believes in the collective strength of the developer community. 

By making the entire codebase accessible on fairhive-lab’s GitHub, PoLN invites collective innovation, feedback, and enhancements, all while ensuring transparency.
