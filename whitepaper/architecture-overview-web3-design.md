# 🚧 (WIP) Architecture Overview

It ‘s an **amazing solution** if you want to **decentralize backend services**.

There are also **many Ethereum compatible projects** providing, today, the **capability** **to** **work** **with** different **Ethereum blockchains**, supporting a kind of interoperability with new protocols and new projects.

**On-chain** backend services (_smart contracts_) will be developed using **solidity**, deployed on testnet and then on mainnet.

**Off-chain** services (_secured rest api_) will be developed using **golang**, tested and deployed on **Docker/Kubernetes** cloud clusters.

They will also access the smart contract services.

**Frontend** will leverage [**metamask**](https://metamask.io/download/) and coinbase wallet plugins into an **Angular** application (_webapp_) using [**ethers.js**](https://docs.ethers.io/) open library.

**All code sources will be open** and hosted on fairhive-lab’s G**ithub.**

Frontend and Rest-API images will be built and deployed thanks to devops features of G**ithub** and **CircleCI.**

Rest-API services will be deployed **on Heroku** and **AWS.**
