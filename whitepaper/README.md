# Why PoLN ?

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Document Versioning Disclaimer**



This whitepaper is a living document and may be updated or revised periodically to reflect the latest developments, insights, or changes related to the PoLN protocol.&#x20;

Each version of this document supersedes all prior versions. Readers are advised to ensure they are referencing the most recent version of this whitepaper and to stay informed of any updates or changes by visiting our official channels or website.

{% hint style="info" %}
In a more virtuous economy compared to the traditional model, if we hypothesize that work is the backbone of capitalism, then DeFi's foundational weakness is its exclusion of work.

Catalyzing the integration of work into decentralized finance might drive more equitable wealth distribution, allowing individuals to genuinely have skin in the game, which in turn could elevate trust and assurance in the evolving system.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
PoLN stands as a testament to progressive and equitable economic models, serving as a transformative response to challenges such as the constraints of a fossil fuel-dependent economy, escalating wealth inequality, unmet aspirations of newer generations, and rigid work structures.
{% endhint %}

## PoLN will be a decentralized system built upon 10 ambitious objectives

1. **Forge a Supportive Community**: Establish and nurture a blockchain-powered community where members actively assist and uplift each other, promoting mutual growth and sharing of resources and opportunities within the decentralized ecosystem.
2. **Foster Inclusivity and Accessibility**: Harness the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies to ensure everyone, regardless of their socio-economic status, has access to the benefits of the economy, breaking barriers traditionally set by centralized financial systems.
3. **Empower Labor**: Use blockchain-based platforms to recognize and reward work, ensuring fair compensation and recognizing the value of every individual's contribution.
4. **Facilitate Equitable Wealth Distribution**: Implement crypto-based reward and incentive systems that promote more equitable sharing of economic benefits among all participants.
5. **Promote Ethical Transactions**: Leverage the transparency of blockchain to ensure all economic activities uphold the highest ethical standards, minimizing fraud and corruption.
6. **Implement Secure and Rapid Crypto-Payments**: Integrate advanced cryptographic techniques to facilitate rapide and secure transactions, minimizing delays and ensuring that users can confidently and efficiently trade, invest, and transact using cryptocurrencies.
7. **Enhance Stakeholder Participation**: Encourage individuals to actively participate in the economic system by offering mechanisms where they can have direct "skin in the game," such as tokenized assets or staking opportunities.
8. **Community-Driven Protocol Development**: Ensure that the underlying protocols and systems are developed collaboratively by the community and independent developers, promoting decentralization, diversity of thought, and tailoring solutions to the real needs and aspirations of users.
9. **Drive Innovation and Modernization**: Transition from traditional financial mechanisms to decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, embracing the capabilities of cryptocurrency to streamline and democratize financial processes.
10. **Strengthen Trust and Reliability**: Utilize the immutable and transparent nature of blockchain to build a foundation of trust, ensuring all transactions are verifiable and authentic, thereby boosting overall confidence in the system.

{% hint style="success" %}
The ten core objectives laid out by PoLN are not merely reactive but are a proactive blueprint for forging a supportive community, promoting inclusivity, and driving innovation, turning challenges into opportunities for growth and development.
