# ðŸš§ (WIP) Tokenomics

With a fixed total supply of tokens, the protocol ensures value through scarcity.&#x20;

This supply is carefully distributed among initiators, agents, contractors, mentors, and other stakeholders, ensuring alignment with the platformâ€™s growth goals and reserving a portion for potential future collaborations.

The utility of the PoLN tokens ($POLN) extends across various facets of the ecosystem. From governance participation to fee facilitation, rewards distribution, and staking opportunities, the tokens are pivotal in driving community interaction and engagement.&#x20;

Moreover, as the platform matures, the diverse utility of these tokens, coupled with active community participation, aims to steadily amplify demand.

Strategies for maintaining the token's value range from potential inflation or deflation mechanisms, like token burning or minting, to fostering liquidity through partnerships with exchanges or liquidity pools.&#x20;

Additionally, vesting periods might be set for certain allocations, ensuring long-term commitment from beneficiaries.&#x20;

Within this framework, rewards and incentives form a core component, enriching the contributions from initiators, agents, mentors, and contractors.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
All these mechanisms, underpinned by a commitment to progressive decentralization and polycentric governance, promise a future where the community not only benefits from but actively shapes PoLN's direction and growth.
