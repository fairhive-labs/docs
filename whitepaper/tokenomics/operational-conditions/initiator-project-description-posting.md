# Initiator's project description and posting

When an initiator decides to launch a project on the PoLN protocol, the first step involves comprehensively detailing the project.

This detail encompasses the scope, a brief introduction, any technical specifications, the expected duration and its unit (e.g., days, weeks), the payment amount in a chosen stablecoin for the contractor, and the associated $POLN fee (which should not be less than 10% of the contractor's payment).&#x20;

This entire description serves as a Request for Proposals (RFP) or a call for bids.

## Deadlines and Discarding Projects

If there are no bids or interactions with the project within a predefined period, the project may be automatically hidden or archived, signaling it as potentially outdated or less attractive.&#x20;

While an initiator can search for and approach potential agents, mentors, or contractors directly, the lack of engagement with a project often indicates its lesser appeal to the community.&#x20;

Initiators have the flexibility to discard a project, either due to a lack of bids, errors in project description, or any other unforeseen circumstances that may arise during the posting phase.

## Verification System for Initiators

To bolster the protocol's credibility, initiators undergo a verification process before posting. This process can include authenticating email addresses, cross-referencing social media accounts, or even, for larger projects, verifying business registration details or LinkedIn profiles. Profiles that pass this scrutiny can sport a badge, signaling their verified status to other users.

## Escrow System

Once an RFP is active and collaborations begin, an escrow system locks the agreed-upon payment. This escrow ensures contractors that funds are reserved for them upon project completion and assures initiators that payments are contingent upon meeting the set milestones or deliverables.

## Open Communication Channel

While PoLN doesn't directly embed a communication platform, it actively encourages and facilitates communication through a dedicated Discord server for the PoLN community. On this server, initiators and fellowships can create private channels for specific projects, ensuring discussions remain organized and relevant.&#x20;

Discord's robust infrastructure supports both text and voice communication, allowing for real-time discussions, brainstorming sessions, and progress updates.&#x20;

Additionally, for those preferring other platforms, PoLN acknowledges and respects the use of external communication tools like Telegram and WhatsApp. The essence is to maintain open, transparent, and timely communication, irrespective of the chosen platform.

## Feedback and Rating System

Upon project completion, a feedback loop where both the initiator and the fellowship can rate and review each other enhances trust within the community, guiding future collaborations.

## Milestone Approval System

A segmented review system where projects are split into milestones can be adopted. As each phase is finalized, the initiator evaluates and approves it, ensuring consistent alignment and real-time issue resolution.

## Education and Guidelines

By disseminating guidelines on platform best practices and potential pitfalls, initiators and fellowships can be better equipped. Periodic workshops or tutorials can further enrich the community's knowledge base.

## Future Project Moderation

As the PoLN community grows and evolves, there might be considerations in the future to have project moderation.&#x20;

Community members, through a DAO structure, could review, validate, and even provide insights on projects, ensuring a consistent standard of quality and authenticity.

## Project Edit or Update

An initiator can edit the project description, and blockchain events (like those in Solidity smart contracts) can notify "following" fellowships of updates.&#x20;

This ensures transparency and keeps all parties informed in real-time.

## Budget Transparency

Making the budget public provides clarity to fellowships, enabling them to gauge if the project aligns with their expertise and expectations.&#x20;

It sets the right expectations and eliminates potential confusions or disputes later on.

## Skillset and Experience Requirement

By allowing initiators to specify qualifications, experiences, or skillsets, the protocol ensures that only relevant and competent fellowships respond.&#x20;

This optimizes the match-making process between projects and fellowships.

## Confidentiality Concerns: Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and Cryptographic Security

The Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), often referred to as a confidentiality agreement, is a legally binding contract that ensures the shared confidential material, knowledge, or data will not be made available to any third party. In the context of the PoLN protocol, when initiators are looking to disclose sensitive project details, they can request fellowships to sign an NDA. This allows the initiator to share intricate project details with fellowships securely. Beyond traditional NDAs, the power of blockchain's cryptographic systems can be leveraged for added security. Initiators can encrypt sensitive content so that it can only be deciphered by trusted fellowships. These fellowships, after signing the NDA, would be provided with a unique cryptographic key or a specific secret message. This message acts as a digital signature, granting them access to the encrypted content. Thus, the synergy of traditional legal structures and blockchain technology ensures that confidential information remains in the hands of only those permitted to see it, marrying the strengths of both worlds for enhanced security and trust.

With these systems and measures in place, PoLN aims to create a balanced environment where initiators can post projects with confidence and fellowships can engage with them, knowing that there's a robust framework safeguarding their interests.
