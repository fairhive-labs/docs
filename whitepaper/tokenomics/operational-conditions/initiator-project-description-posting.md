# Project Initiation and RFP Posting

When an initiator decides to launch a project on the PoLN protocol, the process begins with a quick introduction of the project concept. This often includes initial input from potential fellowships to help shape the project's direction.

The collaboration continues as the initiator thoroughly details the project through an iterative process, using PoLN's Discord or other social platforms for ongoing input and refinement from fellowships.

Once the brief description is finalized, the next step is the formal submission of a Request for Proposal (RFP). This step invites further engagement and formalizes the search for collaborations and resources.

The RFP details the scope, a brief introduction, any technical specifications, the expected project duration in units such as days or weeks, the payment amount in a chosen stablecoin for the contractor, and the associated $POLN fee, which should not be less than 2% of the contractor's payment.

This comprehensive description not only serves as an RFP but also as a call for bids, setting the stage for competitive and collaborative project development.

## Education and Guidelines

By disseminating guidelines on platform best practices and potential pitfalls, initiators and fellowships can be better equipped.

Periodic workshops or tutorials can further enrich the community's knowledge base.

## Verification System for Initiators

To bolster the protocol's credibility, initiators undergo a verification process before posting.

This process can include authenticating email addresses, cross-referencing social media accounts, or even, for larger projects, verifying business registration details or LinkedIn profiles.

Profiles that pass this scrutiny can sport a badge, signaling their verified status to other users.

## Open Communication Channel

While PoLN doesn't directly embed a communication platform, it actively encourages and facilitates communication through a dedicated Discord server for the PoLN community. On this server, initiators and fellowships can create private channels for specific projects, ensuring discussions remain organized and relevant.

Discord's robust infrastructure supports both text and voice communication, allowing for real-time discussions, brainstorming sessions, and progress updates.

Additionally, for those preferring other platforms, PoLN acknowledges and respects the use of external communication tools like Telegram and WhatsApp. The essence is to maintain open, transparent, and timely communication, irrespective of the chosen platform.

## Confidentiality Concerns: Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) and Cryptographic Security

The Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), often referred to as a confidentiality agreement, is a legally binding contract that ensures the shared confidential material, knowledge, or data will not be made available to any third party.

In the context of the PoLN protocol, when initiators are looking to disclose sensitive project details, they can request fellowships to sign an NDA. This allows the initiator to share intricate project details with fellowships securely.

Beyond traditional NDAs, the power of blockchain's cryptographic systems can be leveraged for added security.

Initiators can encrypt sensitive content so that it can only be deciphered by trusted fellowships.

These fellowships, after signing the NDA, would be provided with a unique cryptographic key or a specific secret message.

This message acts as a digital signature, granting them access to the encrypted content.

Thus, the synergy of traditional legal structures and blockchain technology ensures that confidential information remains in the hands of only those permitted to see it, marrying the strengths of both worlds for enhanced security and trust.

## Skillset and Experience Requirement

Initiators often come with a precise vision for their projects. This vision not only encompasses the project outcome but also the expertise required to realize it.

By enabling initiators to detail specific qualifications, experiences, or skillsets they're seeking, the protocol ensures a targeted and efficient project-to-fellowship matching.

This feature eliminates the noise of mismatched or underqualified bids, greatly reducing the time and effort that would otherwise be spent in sifting through unsuitable proposals.

It further ensures that the fellowships that respond are not only technically competent but are also aligned with the project's unique demands and nuances.

Such a tailored approach paves the way for a smoother project lifecycle, from initiation to completion, fostering a symbiotic relationship between the initiators and fellowships.

## Budget Transparency

Financial transparency is a cornerstone of trust in collaborative endeavors, especially in decentralized environments like PoLN.

By ensuring budget transparency, initiators lay all financial cards on the table from the outset.

This transparency has several profound benefits.

First, it allows fellowships to make informed decisions. They can assess not only the project's feasibility in relation to its budget but also weigh the economic viability for their own sustenance and growth. A clear budgetary outline helps fellowships discern if the financial compensation aligns with the effort, time, and resources they plan to invest.

Moreover, by disclosing budgetary allocations, potential ambiguities or misunderstandings that might arise during the project's lifecycle are substantially minimized. This preemptive clarity can be instrumental in preventing disputes, saving both the initiator and fellowship time and resources that might otherwise be spent in negotiations or conflict resolution.

Lastly, such transparency reflects the initiator's commitment and credibility. It shows that they respect the fellowship's need for clarity and are sincere about the project's requirements and constraints. This fosters a foundation of trust, mutual respect, and cooperation, which are indispensable for successful project execution in decentralized platforms.

## Escrow System

In the initial project description and posting phase, indicating the use of an escrow system for the funds can bolster the project's credibility.

Potential collaborators can immediately recognize the initiator's serious intent and the safeguarded nature of the payment.

The mere mention of an escrow, at this stage, underscores a commitment to transparency and trustworthiness, enticing qualified fellowships to engage.

## Milestone Approval System

A segmented review system where projects are split into milestones can be adopted.

As each phase is finalized, the initiator evaluates and approves it, ensuring consistent alignment and real-time issue resolution.

## Deadlines and Discarding Projects

If there are no bids or interactions with the project within a predefined period, the project may be automatically hidden or archived, signaling it as potentially outdated or less attractive.

While an initiator can search for and approach potential agents, mentors, or contractors directly, the lack of engagement with a project often indicates its lesser appeal to the community.

Initiators have the flexibility to discard a project, either due to a lack of bids, errors in project description, or any other unforeseen circumstances that may arise during the posting phase.

## Project Edit or Update

An initiator can edit the project description, and blockchain events (like those in Solidity smart contracts) can notify "following" fellowships of updates.

This ensures transparency and keeps all parties informed in real-time.

## Feedback and Rating System

A cornerstone of PoLN's ecosystem is its feedback and rating mechanism, which comes into play upon a project's conclusion.

This system provides a platform for both the initiator and the fellowship to share their experiences, rate, and review each other.

Such shared insights bolster the community's trust, offering transparency and aiding members in future collaboration decisions.

However, while the fellowship's feedback serves primarily as a testimonial, adding value for future initiators considering that fellowship for projects, it's the initiator's evaluation that holds significant weight in the protocol's functioning. The initiator's feedback directly influences the reward distributions, determining whether the project is deemed a success or failure. It's this feedback that becomes the basis for unlocking escrowed funds, distributing protocol fees, and determining the status of staked tokens.

In essence, while mutual feedback fosters a sense of community trust and knowledge-sharing, it's the initiator's evaluation that has tangible implications on the protocol's economic and operational outcomes.

## Future Project Moderation

As the PoLN community grows and evolves, there might be considerations in the future to have project moderation.

Community members, through a DAO structure, could review, validate, and even provide insights on projects, ensuring a consistent standard of quality and authenticity.
