# ‚õè (preview) Operational Conditions

The PoLN protocol operates within a set of phases, each carefully designed to ensure transparency, efficiency, and commitment from all parties involved. 

These operational phases lay the foundation for the protocol's functioning and streamline the project lifecycle. 

Here's a brief overview:

1. **Initiator's project description and posting:** This phase is the starting point, focusing on how an initiator outlines a project. It emphasizes setting clear parameters and handling confidentiality concerns, ensuring the project's requirements are well-understood by potential bidders.
2. **Fellowship Formation and Bidding:** A core phase where fellowships are formed, harnessing diverse skillsets and expertise. The bidding process is also elucidated, detailing how fellowships showcase their capabilities and propose their strategies for project execution.
3. **Staking & Payment Locks:** This segment underscores the commitment aspect of the protocol. Through staking mechanisms, both the fellowship and initiator guarantee their dedication to the project, ensuring that they have skin in the game.
4. **Project Execution & Evaluation:** At the heart of the protocol lies the actual execution of the project. This phase delves into the nuts and bolts of project management, with an emphasis on continuous monitoring and evaluation from both the initiator's and the fellowship's vantage points.
5. **Reward & Fee Distribution:** The culmination of the project lifecycle, this phase breaks down the distribution of rewards and fees. It provides clarity on how dues are settled, whether in the case of successful project completion or potential failures.

While the operational conditions outlined above establish the foundational framework of PoLN's operations, there are additional dimensions which, though not yet detailed extensively, are pivotal for the protocol's long-term evolution and optimization.

These include:

* **Dispute Resolution:** A vital aspect that could be further expanded upon, focusing on structured mechanisms to handle disagreements or unmet expectations.
* **Continuous Learning & Platform Improvement:** Embracing feedback from past projects can offer invaluable insights. This phase would emphasize refining the platform and fostering a culture of continuous learning among fellowships.
* **Community Engagement & Governance:** Democracy and decentralization are at the heart of blockchain protocols. This phase would foster a sense of ownership among the PoLN community, enabling members to have a say in decision-making and protocol evolution.
* **Onboarding & Training:** As PoLN grows, welcoming new members and ensuring they are well-acquainted with the platform's ethos will be crucial. This phase would ensure smooth assimilation and adherence to best practices.
