# ⛏ (preview) Operational Conditions

The PoLN protocol operates within a set of phases, each carefully designed to ensure transparency, efficiency, and commitment from all parties involved. These operational phases lay the foundation for the protocol's functioning and streamline the project lifecycle. 

Here's a brief overview:

1. **Initiator's Project Description and Posting:** This phase is the starting point, focusing on how an initiator outlines a project. It emphasizes setting clear parameters and handling confidentiality concerns, ensuring the project's requirements are well-understood by potential bidders.
2. **Fellowship Formation and Bidding:** A core phase where fellowships are formed, harnessing diverse skillsets and expertise. The bidding process is also elucidated, detailing how fellowships showcase their capabilities and propose their strategies for project execution.
3. **Staking & Payment Locks:** This segment underscores the commitment aspect of the protocol. Through staking mechanisms, both the fellowship and initiator guarantee their dedication to the project, ensuring that they have skin in the game.
4. **Project Execution & Evaluation:** At the heart of the protocol lies the actual execution of the project. This phase delves into the nuts and bolts of project management, with an emphasis on continuous monitoring and evaluation from both the initiator's and the fellowship's vantage points.
5. **Reward & Fee Distribution:** The culmination of the project lifecycle, this phase breaks down the distribution of rewards and fees. It provides clarity on how dues are settled, whether in the case of successful project completion or potential failures.

## **Project Execution & Evaluation**

In the decentralized ecosystem facilitated by the PoLN protocol, the protocol serves primarily as a trust layer, ensuring staking, fee management, and reward distribution. However, project execution largely follows the agreed terms between the initiator and the fellowship, outside of the protocol's direct oversight.

### **Project Execution**

While the PoLN protocol isn't a comprehensive project management solution, it does establish the foundational elements of trust and commitment. Once a project commences:

* The initiator and fellowship operate based on their agreement, likely leveraging external project management tools or communication platforms such as Discord, Telegram, or WhatsApp.
* Progress markers or milestones might be established in the agreement, serving as checkpoints. These checkpoints can be tied to payment releases or updates within the PoLN protocol, allowing for transparent tracking of project progression.

### **Project Evaluation**

Evaluation is critical to ensure both the initiator's satisfaction and the fellowship's proper compensation. A few potential evaluation criteria could be:

* [ ] **Completion Accuracy:** How closely does the finished product align with the original project description and requirements?
* [ ] **Timeliness:** Did the fellowship complete the project within the stipulated timeframe? Were milestones achieved as scheduled?
* [ ] **Quality of Work:** Beyond mere completion, is the work of a high standard, meeting or surpassing industry benchmarks?
* [ ] **Quality of Communication:** Were updates, issues, and changes communicated effectively and promptly by the fellowship? Did the fellowship maintain transparency throughout the process?
* [ ] **Resource Management:** Were resources, both in terms of budget and manpower, utilized efficiently? Did the fellowship stick to the budgetary confines, if any were set?
* [ ] **Stakeholder Feedback:** This incorporates feedback not just from the initiator but also from any other affected parties, ensuring a holistic review of the project's impact.
* [ ] **Adaptability:** How did the fellowship handle unforeseen challenges or obstacles? Was there agility in problem-solving and finding alternative solutions?
* [ ] **Team Collaboration:** If the project involved multiple members from the fellowship, how well did they collaborate? Was there cohesion in the team's efforts?
* [ ] **Technology and Innovation:** Did the fellowship employ the latest technologies, methodologies, or innovative solutions suitable for the project?
* [ ] **Ethical Considerations:** Were all stages of the project executed ethically, respecting all involved parties, data protection standards, and industry best practices?
* [ ] **Client Satisfaction:** Beyond the tangible outcomes, was the initiator or client content with the working relationship, the fellowship's responsiveness, and overall experience?
* [ ] **Value for Money:** Considering the fees involved, did the fellowship provide a result that signifies good value for the money invested by the initiator?
* [ ] **Knowledge Transfer:** If applicable, did the fellowship provide adequate training, documentation, or support for the initiator to understand and utilize the delivered product or service?
* [ ] **Environmental and Social Impact:** Especially relevant for larger projects, was there consideration of environmental sustainability and positive social impact?
* [ ] **Post-Completion Support:** Was there a mechanism for addressing post-completion queries, concerns, or required tweaks? How committed was the fellowship in ensuring smooth transition post-project?

## Reward & Fee Distribution

In the decentralized world of PoLN, the act of compensating contributors for their efforts is paramount. This reward and fee distribution phase seeks to ensure that all stakeholders, be it initiators, fellowships, or the broader community, are fairly remunerated for their roles. Here, we delve into the intricacies of how value is allocated and distributed across the protocol, ensuring that there's skin in the game, commitment is sustained, and quality is continuously delivered. The system is meticulously designed, integrating a robust reward matrix for initiators based on project duration and a well-structured distribution plan for protocol fees. By doing so, PoLN creates a harmonious ecosystem where contributors are incentivized to align with the platform's objectives, leading to better outcomes for all. Dive in to understand the precision with which PoLN has crafted its reward and fee distribution mechanism.

### **Success Scenario**

Upon the successful completion of a project, the distribution system activates:

* **Fellowship:** The fellowship retrieves its staked tokens, and in addition, they are awarded the protocol fees as their primary remuneration.
* **Initiator:** The initiator gets rewarded from a predefined token pool based on the project's duration and the associated unit. The reward calculation is based on a matrix/grid system that considers both the project's duration and its time unit. As an example, for an 8 months long project, the initiator would receive 65536 $POLN.

### **Unsuccessful Scenario**

In the event a project is deemed unsuccessful:

* **Fellowship:** The fellowship loses its staked tokens as they are burnt, which incurs a financial loss for them. They also miss out on the protocol fees.
* **Initiator:** The initiator does not receive any reward.
* **Community:** The protocol fees, which would have otherwise gone to the fellowship, are redirected to the broader community. These funds are used for operations like training, helpdesk and support, mediation, KYC, development, maintenance, and refilling the initiator rewards pool.

### **Aborted Projects**

If a project is terminated before its set deadline:

* **Fellowship:** The fellowship's staked tokens are burnt.
* **Initiator:** The initiator can claim back the remaining payment that was locked for the contractor since they will no longer be getting paid. However, the initiator does not receive any rewards, and any protocol fees already paid are not refunded.
* **Community:** The community receives the protocol fees for their continued operational support.

### **Halving Mechanism for Initiator Rewards**

To ensure the sustainability of the reward system, there's a halving mechanism in place. As the token pool for initiator rewards depletes and reaches a reduction of 50%, the reward rates for initiators will be halved. This ensures that even as the available tokens in the pool reduce, the system can continue rewarding initiators for a longer period, thereby maintaining the attractiveness and viability of the PoLN platform.

{% hint style="success" %}
This mechanism ensures that all the stakeholders in a project, be it the initiator, the fellowship, or the community, have a clear understanding of the potential gains or losses. It emphasizes both the rewards for successful completion and the penalties for failures, thereby motivating all parties to maintain high standards of work and commitment.
