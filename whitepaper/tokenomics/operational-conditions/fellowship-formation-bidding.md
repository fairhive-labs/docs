# **Fellowship formation and bidding**

## **Multiple Fellowship Membership**

An individual on the PoLN platform can be part of various fellowships simultaneously.&#x20;

It's up to the individual to manage their commitments and time effectively across different projects. This flexibility promotes a dynamic ecosystem where talent can contribute to multiple initiatives based on their expertise and interests.

## **Team Formation & Collaboration**

Upon the posting of a project by an initiator, individuals or pre-formed teams (agents, mentors, and contractors) can come together to form a fellowship. A fellowship might be a team newly formed for a specific project or an existing team with a track record from prior projects.&#x20;

Platforms like Discord enable these individuals to communicate, establish partnerships, strategize, and finalize the roles and contributions of each member.

## **Staking & Skin in the Game**

Fellowships, to demonstrate commitment and differentiate themselves in the bidding process, indicate how much $POLN they're willing to stake on the project.&#x20;

The minimum staking amount for a fellowship is set at 10% of the total fees that the initiator will pay for the project.&#x20;

This staking acts as a strong signal to the initiator regarding the seriousness and confidence of the fellowship in the project's success. Higher stakes from a fellowship may be perceived as a deeper commitment and trust in the project's potential.

## **Bid Preparation**

After internal discussions and potential dialogues with the initiator, fellowships prepare a bid.&#x20;

This encompasses the strategy they propose, their collective skills and experiences, the total $POLN they're staking, and any other terms or conditions.&#x20;

The bid also clarifies how they intend to distribute the rewards and fees upon project completion, ensuring transparency for all parties involved.

## **Competitive Bidding & Choice**

If multiple fellowships bid for the same project, the initiator has the freedom to select the one they find most suitable.&#x20;

They can base their decision on various factors such as track records, team composition, staking amount, or any other criteria they value.&#x20;

This competitive structure ensures that initiators have access to the best talent and proposals.

## **Submission & Negotiation**

Fellowships submit their proposals to the initiator after bid preparation.&#x20;

The initiator can then review all the bids, engage in discussions, seek clarifications, and negotiate terms with one or more fellowships, ensuring the best fit for their project.

## **Bid Acceptance & Project Commencement**

The initiator holds the sole authority to accept or decline the bids presented by the fellowships.&#x20;

If a bid aligns with the initiator's requirements and is accepted, the chosen fellowship is then required to stake their committed amount first.&#x20;

Following this, the initiator pays the project fees, which are locked into an escrow smart contract, separate from the staking process.&#x20;

Only when both the fellowship's stake and the initiator's fees are securely locked does the protocol flag the project as officially commenced.

## **Feedback & Continuous Engagement**

As the project evolves, fellowships can update the initiator on milestones, challenges, or any strategic adjustments.&#x20;

Regular feedback and open communication channels, like the PoLN Discord server, ensure alignment and transparency between both parties throughout the project's lifecycle.
