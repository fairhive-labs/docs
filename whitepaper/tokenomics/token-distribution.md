# ðŸš§ (WIP) Distribution

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/chart.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Regarding the **prime purpose of the protocol**, a large amount of tokens should be traded, in order to:

* **boost** the **business relationships** between Clients, Talents and Stakers,
* mitigate the volatility of the token price.

Depending on the amount of the stake and locktime duration, the **Stakers** (Agents/Mentors) will get **rewards from the Earning pool**.

The builders (team) and the DAO (community) will each receive a comparable share, with the team's tokens undergoing a gradual vesting process over 3 years.

**Developing the \_testnet**\_ will be an important part of the delivery which will require a specific endowment (offer incentives for contributors).

Last but not least, tokens will be distributed:

* to **strategic partners** (advisors, media, etc),
* for **marketing** purposes (airdrops, giveaways, games/lottery, etc).
