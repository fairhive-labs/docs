The following detailed breakdown elucidates the allocation priorities of the $POLN token, highlighting a dedication to forging a balanced, utility-driven ecosystem.

## Public Sales and Listings Strategy

| Tokens ($POLN) | Percentage (%) |
| :------------: | :------------: |
|  `60,000,000` |      `30`      |

The design and distribution of the $POLN token underscores PoLN's commitment to ensuring broad and decentralized access.

Such accessibility, while promoting decentralization, also seeks to discourage concentrated power within the ecosystem.

The challenge, however, is to provide widespread access while simultaneously discouraging short-term speculative behaviors.

A well-orchestrated public sales strategy—comprising both Initial DEX Offerings (IDO) and Initial Exchange Offerings (IEO)—serves as a solution. This approach not only offers immediate accessibility but also encourages long-term engagement and commitment to the PoLN ecosystem.

### Initial DEX Offering (IDO)

Embracing the ethos of decentralization and aiming for a solid introduction of $POLN in the market, the first strategic step involves an Initial DEX Offering (IDO).

This represents 20% of the public sales and listing pool, amounting to 12,000,000 $POLN.

The primary intent behind an IDO is to engage with the core DeFi community and early adopters.

Through an IDO, there's an opportunity for a fair and wide initial distribution, promoting community ownership. This method also provides a platform for organic price discovery, setting the stage for a sustainable market value of $POLN.

### Initial Exchange Offering (IEO)

Subsequent to the IDO, the plan is to expand $POLN's reach and accessibility with an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO).

This phase will use 50% of the public sales and listing pool, equating to 30,000,000 $POLN.

An IEO is a strategy to capitalize on the reputation of established centralized exchanges, crucial for presenting $POLN to a more extensive and potentially global investor base.

Centralized exchanges offer advantages in terms of promotional reach, visibility, security, seamless acquisition, and potential price stability due to the controlled token release mechanisms typical of IEOs.

### Exchange Listing

To ensure sustained accessibility, liquidity, and growth potential for $POLN, 30% of the public sales and listing pool (which is 18,000,000 $POLN) is allocated for liquidity provisions on various exchange listings.

Listing $POLN on a combination of decentralized and centralized exchanges aims to provide choice, accessibility, and smooth trading experiences to users.

Such diverse listing platforms promote a decentralized token holding pattern and, in turn, reinforce the overall ecosystem's health.

## Initiator Rewards

| Tokens ($POLN) | Percentage (%) |
| :------------: | :------------: |
|  `40,000,000`  |      `20`      |

The essence of any thriving ecosystem lies in its ability to attract and retain key participants.

For the PoLN system, these are the initiators who bring projects and collaborative opportunities to the table.

By setting aside a significant allocation for initiator rewards, the protocol emphasizes the central role that these entities play.

### Incentivizing High-Quality Proposals

One of the primary purposes of the initiator rewards is to incentivize the introduction of high-quality, viable projects to the PoLN ecosystem.

By offering tangible rewards, the protocol encourages initiators to present well-researched and feasible projects, which in turn contributes to the overall success rate and reputation of the system.

### Stimulating Ecosystem Growth

As more initiators bring projects to the protocol, there's a natural ripple effect. More projects mean more fellowships are formed, which can lead to more successful collaborations, thereby creating an upward spiral of growth and success for the entire PoLN community.

### Halving Mechanism for Longevity

The inclusion of a [halving mechanism for initiator rewards](operational-conditions/reward-fee-distribution.md#halving-mechanism-for-initiator-rewards) is both strategic and forward-thinking.

Just as Bitcoin employs halving to manage its supply and ensure longevity, PoLN uses a similar approach to ensure the rewards pool doesn't deplete rapidly.

This halving mechanism serves a dual purpose:

* **Sustainability**: The halving mechanism in the rewards structure creates an incentive for early adopters of the PoLN protocol by providing them with a larger share of rewards. As the reward size decreases over time, it extends the longevity of the pool, allowing for potentially hundreds of thousands of projects to benefit, at a minimum. While the rewards aren't infinite, this approach ensures a sustained motivation for initiators over an extended period, making it a strategic tool for both immediate and long-term growth of the PoLN ecosystem.
* **Reflecting Ecosystem Value**: As the PoLN system grows and matures, the intrinsic value of being a part of this community also rises. The halving mechanism reflects this increasing value, with the idea being that even reduced rewards in the future hold greater value due to the enhanced reputation and success rate of the system.

### Reward Scaling with Success

The structure of the rewards not only incentivizes project initiation but also ties rewards to the successful completion of projects.

This ensures that initiators remain engaged throughout the project lifecycle and are committed to seeing their projects through to successful conclusions.

## Builders (fairhive-labs)

| Tokens ($POLN) | Percentage (%) |
| :------------: | :------------: |
|  `20,000,000`  |      `10`      |

The allocation designated for the builders, primarily the fairhive-labs team, is a testament to the belief in the long-term success and viability of the PoLN protocol.

This allocation, rather than an immediate payout, is structured to align the interests of the team with the sustainable growth and evolution of the system over time.

### Two-Year Lock

Before any tokens become available, there's a two-year lock in place.

This period serves multiple purposes:

* **Commitment**: It signifies a solid pledge from the team to the protocol and its community. This isn't a short-term endeavor but a long-term vision.
* **Growth and Development Phase**: These two years represent crucial formative moments for the PoLN protocol. The team will be highly focused on development, partnerships, and user acquisition without any financial distractions.

### Vested Unlocking Over Three Years

Post the two-year lock, the tokens don't become immediately available. Instead, they are released gradually over the next three years.

The distribution is as follows:

* **Year 1 (30%)**: After the initial two-year lock, 30% of the allocated tokens become available in the third year. This initial release acknowledges the extensive work done in the foundational years and provides the team with a partial reward for their efforts.
* **Year 2 (30%)**: In the fourth year, an additional 30% is unlocked. This phase likely coincides with a maturing ecosystem, scaling operations, and growing user base.
* **Year 3 (40%)**: The remaining 40% gets unlocked in the fifth year. This more substantial portion towards the end further solidifies the long-term vision and commitment.

### Alignment with Protocol's Health

The staggered release ensures that the team remains incentivized to maintain, innovate, and grow the PoLN system throughout its early stages of development and far beyond.

### Trust & Transparency

Such a structured release strategy enhances trust within the community.

It sends a clear message that the builders are in this journey for the long haul and that their primary motivation is the protocol's success and not immediate financial gains.

## Private Sales
