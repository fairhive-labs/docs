# Value Captured

## **Project Success Fees**

Initiators receive rewards when projects are successfully completed, capturing value for their investment and involvement.

Agents, Contractors and Mentors also earn fees upon successful project delivery, ensuring they are compensated for their efforts and contributions.

As projects succeed and the protocol thrives, members might experience pleasure and pride from collective achievements and shared successes.

## **Staking Rewards**

Fellowships stake $POLN tokens as a testament to their commitment and belief in the projectâ€™s success (skin in the game).

This act of staking serves as a mechanism for capturing value within the fellowships, enhancing both their individual worth and the overall appeal of the PoLN protocol.

## **Community Treasury**

A portion of the value generated within the platform is directed towards a community treasury. This treasury is used to fund future developments, community initiatives, and ensure the ongoing operations and sustainability of the PoLN protocol.

## **Community Empowerment and Participation**

As the demand for $POLN tokens grows due to their diverse utility, community members can benefit from enhanced functionalities and opportunities within the PoLN ecosystem.&#x20;

Holding $POLN tokens allows participants to access platform features, engage in collaborative projects, and contribute to the ecosystem's ongoing development.

## **Governance Participation**

While the main function of $POLN tokens isn't governance, mechanisms may allow token holders to participate in decision-making processes, helping to shape the protocol's future.&#x20;

The decentralized nature of PoLN empowers individuals by giving them more agency and control over their contributions, fostering a sense of ownership and community involvement.

## **Strategic Partnerships and Collaborations**

Value is also captured through partnerships and collaborations that PoLN forms with other entities. These partnerships can lead to additional revenue streams, increased platform utility, and enhanced ecosystem growth.
