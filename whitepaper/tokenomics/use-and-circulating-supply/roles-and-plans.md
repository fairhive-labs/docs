# Principles & Conditions


A **project** is a time-limited work submitted by a single Initiator on the protocol and potentially assigned to a single Contractor.

Regarding the project, the legal agreement between the Initiator and the Contractor is out of the protocol scope.

A **Staker** is a community member who back-up the Contractor and **must stake** on the project.

At the present time, there are two different types of Staker:

* **Agent**, negotiating terms and conditions of a contract, performing soft-skills assessments…
* **Mentor**, advising and controlling the Contractor’s work, performing technical assessments…

A **Fellowship** is an engaged subset of the community, only focusing on project success.

For the Initiator, the Fellowship, **comprising a Contractor and optional Stakers**, is the promise that everything will be performed for the project’s success.

**Stakers** are “**skin-in-the-game**” with the Contractor.

They should **stay involved during the delivery**.

Submitting a project statement on the protocol, a Initiator will :

* **propose** a protocol **Plan** (a level of service) from supported models,
* **provision** the **payment** for the Contractor,
* and **pay** the specific **protocol fees** (a pourcentage based on the Contractor’s payment).

As soon as the project is posted, Stakers (depending on the selected plan) and Contractors can :

* **candidate** to the project (if the Initiator allows direct requests),
* **be found** and **assigned** by the Initiator (if they accept direct requests),
* **recommend** community **members** for a specific role and **collaboration**,
* **build** a fellowship **proposition** with their **favorite** community **members** and submit it to Initiator’s approval.

Stakers _may have no direct relationship_ with the Initiator.

Each **Staker role** can **group** **multiple** **members**, it can be relevant for complex projects but it’s important to mention that they will **share** the provisioned fees when the project will be successfully over.
