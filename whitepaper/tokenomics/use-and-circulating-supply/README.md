# ðŸš§ (WIP) Utility & demand

{% hint style="success" %}
Within this innovative environment, $POLN tokens embody more than just a currency; they act as a benchmark or index, mirroring the intrinsic value of work and effort invested in the system by contractors, whose work essentially sets the reference for $POLN's value and volatility.
{% endhint %}

## Staking & Rewards

A pivotal aspect of PoLNâ€™s structure is the mandatory staking of $POLN tokens by fellowships, not for governance influence but as a representation of their tangible commitment and â€˜skin in the gameâ€™.&#x20;

This unique feature enhances trust and confidence within the community, particularly among initiators, and underscores the fellowships' dedication to the projects they support, subsequently heightening the systemâ€™s overall trust and reliability.

Initiators are rewarded, and fellowships accrue fees upon the successful culmination of projects, fostering a symbiotic relationship between the diverse entities within the ecosystem.

## Scarcity

With a finite total supply of tokens, PoLN ingeniously maintains value through scarcity.&#x20;

The tokens are judiciously distributed amongst various stakeholders â€“ initiators, agents, contractors, mentors, and earmarked for the community and future DAO functions/operations, aligning everyone with the systemâ€™s growth objectives.&#x20;

_<mark style="color:red;">The</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**maximum supply of the token has also a positive impact**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">on the number of</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**ongoing missions**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">and the</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**token price**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">: the number of ongoing missions is bound with the number of circulating tokens which is bound with the token price. So, the token price determines the number of ongoing missions supported by the protocol :</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;">**the higher the price, the higher the number of potential ongoing missions**</mark><mark style="color:red;">!</mark>_

### Supply management

Strategies to uphold the token's value include potential token burning or minting and fostering liquidity through partnerships, thereby adjusting to the varying demands of the ecosystem. Specified conditions, such as achieving milestones or successful project deliveries, could trigger these mechanisms, aiming for a harmonious scarcity and aligning the interests of all stakeholders.

{% hint style="success" %}
All these elements, anchored by a commitment to progressive decentralization and polycentric governance, envision a future where the PoLN community is not merely a beneficiary but an active participant shaping the direction and growth of the platform.&#x20;

This integrated approach to tokenomics showcases PoLNâ€™s dedication to fostering a stable, value-driven, and flourishing ecosystem for all its members.

_As depicted in the picture, the **Client** must **pay the protocol fees only in POLN** but **can pay** the **Talent** in **POLN** or **stablecoin** (long-term missions may require mitigating price volatility)._

_Considering the mission stake, even if a mission has not successfully ended or the Talent is badly scored, the **Stakers retrieve their stakes in any case** (unslashed stake)._

_This schema does not only illustrate how users purchase or handle tokens but also provides additional information highlighting the escrow function : lock and secure payments._

_Assuming the regular **fluctuations of the market**, the escrow can be effective against very aggressive short-term positions because **tokens are locked** for a specific duration and **cannot be traded**._
