## **Issuance**

{% hint style="success" %}
$POLN - pronounced _pollen -_ tokens are pre-minted.
{% endhint %}

It means that all the tokens that will ever exist have been created at one time - specifically, at the launch of the token.

This may contrast with other models like mining or staking where new tokens can be created over time but having $POLN tokens pre-minted has several advantages:

1. **Fixed Supply:** Since all tokens are pre-minted, the total supply is fixed. This introduces a level of scarcity which can be beneficial for token value, as demand increases in a supply-restricted environment.
2. **Predictability and Transparency:** A pre-minted supply allows for more predictability and transparency, which are vital in fostering trust within the community. Users, investors, and participants can have clear information about the tokenomics, which can contribute to the stability of the token value.
3. **Distribution Control:** Having all tokens available from the start facilitates the distribution of tokens according to the planned allocation. This allows for a strategic distribution to various stakeholders such as initiators, agents, contractors, and mentors, aligning incentives and contributing to the ecosystem’s growth and development.
4. **Reduced Risk of Inflation:** Unlike tokens with a mechanism for ongoing issuance, pre-minted tokens don’t carry the risk of inflation due to increased supply. This can contribute to maintaining the purchasing power of $POLN tokens.
5. **Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness:** Since the tokens are already created, there is no need for the energy and computational power that ongoing issuance models like mining require. This makes the PoLN protocol more environmentally friendly and cost-effective.
6. **Community Focus:** With pre-minted tokens, the emphasis can be more on community growth, project development, and achieving the core objectives of PoLN, rather than on the continuous creation of new tokens.
