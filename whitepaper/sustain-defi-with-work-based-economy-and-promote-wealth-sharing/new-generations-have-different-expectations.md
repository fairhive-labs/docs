# New generations have different expectations

{% hint style="info" %}
Ignoring the expectations of new generations, as evidenced by the mismatch between traditional economies and their aspirations, poses significant risks...
{% endhint %}

Such a disconnect can precipitate a talent drain as skilled individuals seek opportunities elsewhere that align more with their values and desires.&#x20;

A decrease in job satisfaction can translate to a disengaged workforce, resulting in lower overall productivity and inhibiting economic innovation and growth.&#x20;

Furthermore, the rise of potential socio-economic disparities, born from this disjunction, can deepen societal divisions. This reduced social cohesion and increased instability threaten not only the immediate societal fabric but also the long-term stability and collective progress of future societies.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Disregarding the needs and aspirations of the younger generation jeopardizes the holistic advancement and harmony of society as a whole.

The integration of blockchain in a work-based economy provides a framework that is resonant with the values, experiences, and aspirations of newer generations, offering them a more transparent, flexible, and global platform for employment and economic activity:

1. **Value for Transparency and Authenticity**: Newer generations, especially Millennials and Gen Z, have shown a strong preference for transparency and authenticity. The decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain, where every transaction is recorded and verifiable, directly caters to this demand.
2. **Digital Natives**: These generations have grown up in the digital age. They are comfortable with, and even expectant of, technological solutions to traditional problems. Blockchain, as an advanced and innovative technology, aligns with their inclination towards digital solutions.
3. **Flexibility and Autonomy**: The newer generations often prioritize flexibility in work, valuing freelance opportunities, remote roles, and diverse job experiences. Blockchain can facilitate this by easing international payments, verifying work experiences, and ensuring contract adherence through smart contracts.
4. **Global Perspective**: Growing up in a more connected world, newer generations often have a more global outlook. Blockchain's borderless nature, enabling seamless international transactions, fits this worldview, allowing them to work and transact globally.
5. **Innovation and Opportunity**: The continuous evolution of blockchain technology offers avenues for entrepreneurial ventures and novel job roles, fitting the innovative spirit of newer generations.
