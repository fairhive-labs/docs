## Status Key

In this documentation, we use specific emojis and abbreviations to quickly indicate the status of various tasks or components:

- ⏳: **Pending (PEND)** 
  - This indicates that the task or component is scheduled or expected to start but hasn't commenced yet.
  
- ⛏️: **Work in Progress (WIP)** 
  - This symbolizes that the task or component is actively being worked on, much like a miner chipping away at a task.

Please refer to this key when interpreting the status emojis and abbreviations throughout the documentation.
