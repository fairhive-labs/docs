Implementing the future of the solution as an _Application Specific BlockChain_ (**layer-1 protocol)** seems to be a good idea, considering:

* scalability,
* future legal/regulatory obligations,
* specific functional requirements (like automatic code execution, authentication/authorization or data protection for e.g.).
